# ediPlayer simple api

## Getting Started
to understand how everything works, look at the example in [app.js](app.js).


to run the demo you can check out this repo and run it. however you need a webserver to do this. 


you can also have a look at [http://mpattest.irt.de/hradio/simpleApi](http://mpattest.irt.de/hradio/simpleApi). it runs this repo.

add [ediPlayerLib.js](ediPlayerLib.js) to your dom. this file will also load [irtdab.js](irtdab.js) and [pthread-main.js](pthread-main.js). make sure all files are part of your project.


the minimal example contains materialize files. *materialize* is *not* a dependecy of the ediPlayer library.
